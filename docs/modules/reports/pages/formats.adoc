= Output Formats

Tackler has support for text and JSON output formats.

== JSON Format

The json format is supposed for human usage, e.g. all values are already formatted similar way as in text based reports.

Also numbers are represented as strings, so there won't be precision or rounding differences between txt and json reports.
