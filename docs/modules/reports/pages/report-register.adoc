== Format

Register report will list for each transaction its date, code and txn subject (note).
Also it will report metadata, e.g. `uuid` and `location` if transaction has these.

Register report will print out xref:usage:gis/txn-geo-location.adoc[transaction geo location]
and uuid for xref:auditing:index.adoc[accounting auditing] if transaction has set location or uuid.

On the right side of report, first column is posting amount for account on that transaction.
Second column on the right side is running total of that account with reported transactions.

See below for example reports.

== Transaction ordering

By Tackler's design constraints input order of transactions is not important, and it does not mandate
transactions processing order.

Transactions are sorted by using transaction's properties in following order to find correct sort order.

....
timestamp, code, description, uuid
....

Tackler supports timestamps up to nanosecond resolution, so timestamp could be used to produce stable 
natural sorting order if transaction producers have syncronized time available
and nanosecond resolution is sufficient.

If all available transactions properties used for ordering are same between several transaction, 
then transaction ordering is undefined. 

[WARNING]
Transactions must have UUIDs, if fully deterministic, stable
and "distributed transaction producers"-safe transaction ordering is needed.

Printed timestamp style has no effect for sorting order.
For example, register report prints each transaction's time with date resolution by default,
but actual value of timestamp is used for determining sort order always.




== Register report configuration

See xref:reference:tackler-toml.adoc[tackler.toml] and `report.register.*` for full
information of register report configuration options.

=== Timestamps in register report

Register report's `timestamp-style` will set how timestamps are
displayed with register report.

Valid values for `timestamp-style` setting are:

[horizontal]
date::
Only date part is displayed (this is default)

seconds::
Date and time is displayed (up to seconds)

full::
Date and time is displayed (up to nanoseconds)

If `report-timezone` is set, then transaction timestamps are converted
into report's time zone and zone info will not be displayed.

If `report-timezone` is not active, then transaction timestamps
are displayed as-is with zone info.

=== Account Selectors

Register report accounts can be selected by Accounts Selectors.
This can be done
by cli option `--accounts`, global `report.accounts` configuration option
or  by using report specific
`report.register.accounts` setting.

If there are no accounts matched with selected regexs with some transaction,
then that transaction is not included into report at all.

See 'timezone', 'report-timezone' options in xref:reference:tackler-toml.adoc[tackler.toml].
