== Configuration discovery

Path to the tackler configuration file is mandatory option.
The philosophy of the configuration is "what you see is what you get",
e.g. there aren't many internal defaults for configuration,
and unknown configuration keys will cause an error.

=== Merging configurations to active set

Tackler will create an active configuration in following way:

* Provided configuration will be the baseline
* Cmd-line arguments will override the provided configuration
