= Filesystem Storage Guide



Tackler's filesystem storage allows journals to
be stored and accessed directly from the
filesystem. It supports two options for
organizing journal data:


1. **Single File by command line argument**:
The entire journal is stored in a single plain
text file. The path to the journal file is
given as command line argument.
+
This is the simplest way to manage the journal
It is ideal for analysing ad-hoc datasets,
especially when those are not part of the
official journal.


2. **Journal Directory**:
The journal is stored under directory, and it could be split into multiple files,
typically at the transaction level, and could also be stored
in a nested directories
+
This approach, known as sharding, is useful for managing large
datasets or organizing data by specific criteria.


See xref:sharding.adoc[] and xref:examples:production-setups.adoc[] for examples of how to set up production level journal structure.

== Filesystem and Git SCM Storage Backends

There is relationship between Tackler's filesystem storage and Git SCM storage
backends.

When using Git storage with Tackler's filesystem structure, the journal files
(either a single file or a directory structure) are stored in a Git repository.
This allows version control, collaboration, and tracking of changes to the
journal data over time.

Here's how the filesystem structure integrates with Git:

Single File::
The journal is stored as a single plain text file in the Git repository.
Changes to the journal are committed to Git, enabling a complete history of
modifications. This is suitable for single person setup, when there is minimal
change for merge conflicts.


Journal Directory::
The journal is organized into multiple files or nested directories, which are
stored in the Git repository. This structure is ideal for large datasets or when
sharding is used. Each file or directory can represent a subset of the data, and
Git tracks changes to individual files, making it easier to manage and review
updates. This also minimize possibility of merge conflicts, as each file can be
edited individually.

Using Git with Tackler's filesystem storage ensures data integrity, provides a
backup mechanism, and facilitates collaboration among multiple users.

See xref:git-storage.adoc[Git Storage Manual] for more details on how to use Git with Tackler.
